# reaction rates
+ reactants are used as the products are formed
+ **reaction rate** is determined by measuring how quickly the concentration of the reactants decreases or how quickly the concentration of the products increases (speed)
+ can be slow or fast

## calculating reaction rate

```math
rate=\frac{\Delta\,concentration}{\Delta\,time}
```

+ the greek letter delta (triangle) signifies change
+ recall Delta T from calculating heat transfer
+ the unit for a reaction rate is M/s (M = molarity (concentration), s = seconds)
