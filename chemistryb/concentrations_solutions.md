# concentrations of solutions

## solution concentration

- a solution can have more than one solute, but there can only be one solvent in a solution
- the amount of solute dissolved in the solvent determines a substance's concentration

there are several ways to express the concentration of a solution:


### percent by mass and percent by volume

by mass
```math
percent by mass = \frac{mass of solute}{mass of solution} * 100
```
by volume
```math
percent by volume = \frac{volume of solute}{volume of solution} * 100
```
percent by volume is used when liquids or gases are the solute


### parts per million and parts per billion

- closely related to percent by mass (percenti s a ratio that expresses parts per 100)

ppm tells us how many parts a solute makes up of a million (10<sup>6</sup>) parts of a solution
this also tells us the mass in mg of solute in one L of solution 
```math
parts per million = \frac{mass of solute}{mass of solution} * 10^{6} = \frac{mg solute}{L solution}
```
ppb tells us how many parts a solute makes up of a billion (10<sup>9</sup>) parts of a solution
this also tells us the mass in micrograms of solute in one L of solution
```math
parts per billion = \frac{mass of solute}{mass of solution} * 10^{9} = \frac{microgram solute}{L solution}
```

the unit ppm is often associated with the concentration of pollutants when measuring water quality in rivers, lakes, etc.

### molarity
- a common way to express concentration
- the number of moles of solute in 1L of solution
- chemists use this more in the laboratory

```math
molarity\,(M) = \frac{moles\,of\,solute}{liters\,of\,solution}
```
the unit for molarity is mol/L and is abbr as M (molar)
