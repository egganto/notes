# concentrations of solutions

## solution concentration

- a solution can have more than one solute, but there can only be one solvent in a solution
- the amount of solute dissolved in the solvent determines a substance's concentration

there are several ways to express the concentration of a solution:


### percent by mass and percent by volume

by mass
```math
percent\,by\,mass = \frac{mass\,of\,solute}{mass\,of\,solution} * 100
```
by volume
```math
percent\,by\,volume = \frac{volume\,of\,solute}{volume\,of\,solution} * 100
```
percent by volume is used when liquids or gases are the solute


### parts per million and parts per billion

- closely related to percent by mass (percenti s a ratio that expresses parts per 100)

ppm tells us how many parts a solute makes up of a million (10<sup>6</sup>) parts of a solution
this also tells us the mass in mg of solute in one L of solution 
```math
parts\,per\,million = \frac{mass\,of\,solute}{mass\,of\,solution} * 10^{6} = \frac{mg\,solute}{L\,solution}
```
ppb tells us how many parts a solute makes up of a billion (10<sup>9</sup>) parts of a solution
this also tells us the mass in micrograms of solute in one L of solution
```math
parts\,per\,billion = \frac{mass\,of\,solute}{mass\,of\,solution} * 10^{9} = \frac{microgram\,solute}{L\,solution}
```

the unit ppm is often associated with the concentration of pollutants when measuring water quality in rivers, lakes, etc.


### molarity
- a common way to express concentration
- the number of moles of solute in 1L of solution
- chemists use this more in the laboratory

```math
molarity\,(M) = \frac{moles\,of\,solute}{liters\,of\,solution}
```
the unit for molarity is mol/L and is abbr as M (molar)

### dilution

```math
M_{1}V_{1} = M_{2}V_{2}
```
where:
   M<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>1</sub> represent the molarity and volume of the stock solution
   M<sub>2</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> represent the molarity and volume of the dilute solution

V can be any unit but has to be the same on both sides

### colligative properties of solutions
- physical properties of solutions that are affected by the amount of dissolved soluteâ€”but not the identity of the solute
- affected by a chaange in the concentration of a solute

#### vapor pressure depression
- the pressure exerted on the walls of a closed container by the gas particles that have evaporated from the enclosed liquid
- an *increase* in the **concentration of a solute** will cause the **vapor pressure of the solution** to *decrease*
  - an *increase* in **solute** *decreases* the *number of solvent particles to evaporate*

#### boiling point elevation
- the temperature when the vapor pressure is equal to the pressure exerted by the surroundings of the liquid
- an *increase* in the **concentration of a solute** will cause the **boilin point of the solution** to *increase*
  - the *increased* **presence of solute** at the surface of a liquid decreases the number of solvent particles to evaporate (more energy needed to happen)

#### freezing point depression
- the temperature when molecules in the liquid phase transfer into the solid phase
- an *increase* in the **concentration of a solute** will cause the **freezing point of the solution** to *decrease* 
  - the solute get in the way of the solvent particles' abilitty to arrange as a solid form

#### osmotic pressure elevation
- through the process of osmosis, the particles of water pass through the semiperemable membrane from an area of higher solvent concentration to an area of lower solvent concentration
- An increase in the concentration of a solute will cause the osmotic pressure to increase
- more water molecules will move across the membrane, increasing the pressure of the flow
