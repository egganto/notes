# data distributions

## measures of center and spread

### mean
- the **mean** of a data is its average
- is found by summing all values and then dividing by the total

### median
- the middle number, or the average of the middle two numbers in a data set
- if the data set has an even number of values, the median is the average of the mid two #s
- if the data set has an odd number of values, the median is the number in the middle of the set

### standard deviation
- the average distance of any data value from the mean

```math
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{k}\sum_{n=1}^k(n_n-x)^2}
```

k = total number of data values
x<sub>n</sub> = each data value

| calculating standard deviation |
| --- |
| **step 1**: compute the mean (x) of the data set |
| **step 2**: subtract x from each data value, then square the result

if data values are repeated, you must subtract the mean from each one |
| **step 3**: sum the numbers you calculated in **step 2**. then divide by the number of values, getting a new mean |
| **step 4**: take the square root of new mean, this is the value of the standard deviation |
