## counting methods review
### sample space, sets
S = {1,2,3,4,5,6}

A = {1,2,4}

B = {3,4,5}

C = {1,3,5,6}

| **union set** | **intersection set** | **complement** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| A U B | C âˆ© B | C' |
| {1,2,3,4,5} | {3,5} | {2,4} |

##### examples
- counting methods of different items
  ```
  to make a combination for 5 hats, 6 sunglasses, and 3 pairs of flipflops
  5 * 6 * 3 = 90
  ```
  you can have 90 combinations of hats, sunglasses, and flip-flops

- permutations
when order matters
  ```
  <sub>n</sub>P<sub>r</sub> = n!/(n-r)!
  ```
  
- combinations
when order doesn't really matter
  ```
  <sub>n</sub>C<sub>r</sub> = n!/((n-r)!r!)
  
  ```

- stuff
  n = number of objects
  r = number of objects selected
