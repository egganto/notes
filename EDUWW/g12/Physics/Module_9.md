Change in temperature <br>
$$Q=mc\Delta T$$

## Phase Changes & Latent Heat

Equation for Latent Heat: <br>
$Q=mL$
$Q=$ heat/energy <br>
$m=$ mass <br>
$L=$ latent heat <br>
<br>
Fusion: use $L_{f}$ (solid <-> liquid) <br>
Vaporization: use $L_{v}$ (liquid <-> gas) <br>

## Heat, Work, and Thermodynamic Processes

Work Done by a Gas <br>
$$W=\frac{F}{A}(Ad)$$ <br>
$$W=P(\Delta V)$$ <br>

## First Law of Thermodynamics
Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed. <br>
$$
\Delta U = Q - W
$$ <br>
U = internal energy of the system <br>
Q = heat transferred to or from the system <br>
W = work done on or by the system <br>

### Ideal Processes
- Isothermal Process <br>
Work $\leftrightarrow$ Heat <br>
Temperature is constant, so U is constant too <br>
$\Delta U = 0$ <br>
$Q = W$ <br>

- Isovolumetric Process <br>
Heat $\leftrightarrow$ Internal Energy <br>
The volume doesn't change, so no work is done <br>
$W = 0$ <br>
$\Delta U = Q$ <br>

- Adiabatic Process <br>
Work $\leftrightarrow$ Internal Energy <br>
Work is done on/by the system, but no heat is transferred <br>
$Q = 0$ <br>
$\Delta U = -W$ <br>
<br>
If both Q and W are zero, then the equation would just become $U_{i} = U_{f}$.

## Second Law of Thermodynamics
In the long run, entropy (disorder) always increases. <br>
More entropy = less energy available <br>
Entropy always increases unless energy is added. <br>

### Efficiency of Thermodynamic Processes
**Efficiency of an Engine** <br>
$$
eff = \frac{net\ work\ done\ by\ the\ engine}{heat\ added\ to\ the\ engine} = \frac{W_{net}}{Q_{h}}
$$
$$
eff = 1 - \frac{energy\ removed\ as\ heat}{energy\ added\ as\ heat} = 1 - \frac{Q_{c}}{Q_{h}}
$$
