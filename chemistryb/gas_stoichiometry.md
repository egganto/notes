# gas stoichiometry

**recap**
+ avogadro's law says that gases at the same volume, temp, and pressure will have the same number of particles.
+ at a particular temp and pressure, all gases will have the same molar volume,

# standard temperature and pressure (stp) values

standard temperature = 0C = 273.15K
standard pressure = 1 atm = 101.325 kPa = 760 mmHg = 760 torr

+ at STP one mole of any gas will occupy 22.4 L of space.
1 mol = 22.4 L

# volume stoichiometry

+ STP does not change.

```math
volume\,given\,*\frac{L\,desired}{L\,given}=\,volume desired
```

# mass and volume stoichiometry

+ desired unit of desired substance must be in STP.

example

```math
24.8g\,Al*\frac{1\,mol\,Al}{26.98/,g/,Al}*\frac{3\,mol\,O_2}{4\,mol\,Al}*\frac{22.4\,L\,O_2}{1\,mol\,O_2}=15.4\,L\,O_2
```
