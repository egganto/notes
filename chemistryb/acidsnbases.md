# acids and bases

# acids
+ they:
  - are sour, electricity conductors, and corrode metals
+ normally start with H
+ have a pH level lower than 7
+ have a pOH level higher than 7
+ proton donors

# bases
+ they are:
  - bitter/chalky taste, metal conductors, and slippery
+ normally end with OH
+ have a pH level higher than 7
+ have a pOH level lower than 7
+ proton receivers

# neutral
+ water
* has a pH level of 7
+ has a pOH level of 7

# neutralization
+ products are water and salt
+ brings the pH of a substance closer to 7, a neutral value
+ reactants are acid and base

## titration

    equivalence point

```math
moles\,of\,H_3O^+=moles\,of\,OH^-
```

+ between a titrant and an unknown concentration
