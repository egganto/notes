# conic sections


### distance formula
```math
d=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}
```

# circles
### standard equation of a circle
with center (h, k) and r
```math
(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2
```

for its center at the origin (0, 0)
```math
x^2+y^2=r^2
```

# ellipses
### standard equation of an ellipse
```math
\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1
```

### equations and main features of ellipses centered at the origin

| Orientation | Horizontal | Vertical |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Equation in Standard Form** | ```math \frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1``` | ```math \frac{x^2}{b^2}+\frac{y^2}{a^2}=1``` |
| Foci | (c, 0) and (-c, 0) | (0,c) and (0, -c) |
| Major Axis | 2a | 2a |
| Minor Axis | 2b | 2b |

### equation of an ellipse centered at (h, k)

```math
\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2}+\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2}=1
```

or

```math                                       
\frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2}+\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2}=1
```
