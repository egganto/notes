# avogadro's law and the ideal gas law

# avogardro's law
+ the amount of gas is directly related to the volume of the gas when at constant pressure and temperature.

```math
\frac{V_1}{n_1}=\frac{V_2}{n_2}
```
n = amount of gas (moles) present

# the ideal gas law

```math
PV\,=\,nRT
```
R = an experimentally determined constant referred to as the ideal gas constant
+ each variable must have the proper units

| Variable | Unit(s) |
|---|---|
| P | atm, kPa, mmHg, or Torr |
| V | L |
| n | moles |
| R | depends on the pressure unit |
| T | K |

+ R has multiple versions depending on the units of the other variables in the equation

#### atm
```math
R = 0.08206 \frac{L*atm}{mol*k}
```

#### kPa
```math
R = 8.314 \frac{L*kPa}{mol*K}
```

#### mmHg or Torr
```math
R = 62.4 \frac{L*mmHg}{mol*K}
```

# ideal vs real gases

| Feature | Ideal Gases | Real Gases |
|---|---|---|
| Particle Size | Ideal gas particles have no volume. | Real gas aprticles have size and dimension. |
| Attractiive Forces | Ideal gas particles exert no attractive or repulsive forces (IMFs) on each other | Real gas particles ecert IMFs on each other and can attract or repel other gas particles. |
| Particle Motion | Ideal gas particles always travel in straight lines. | Real gas particles might travel in curved paths because of  attractions or repulsions to other gas particles. |
