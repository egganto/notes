# trigonometric functions

# right triangle trigonometry
## triangle sides
| name | side |
| --- | --- |
| hypotenuse | the longest side of the triangle |
| side a | the side opposite to angle A (does not touch it) |
| side c | the side adjacent to side a (the leg that forms angle A with the hypotenuse) |

* sides are just examples, does not apply to all sides

## similar right triangles [souji]
+ two triangles with corresponding congruent angles and proportional corresponding sides

## trigonometric ratios
+ a ratio between two sides of a right triangle
+ three primary trigonometric ratios (trigonometric functions)
  - sine (sin)
  - cosine (cos)
  - tangent (tan)
  - a given angle in a right triangle is called theta

```math
sin(\Theta)=\frac{opposite}{adjacent}
```
```math
cos(\Theta)=\frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse}
```
```math
tan(\Theta)=\frac{opposite}{adjacent}
```
