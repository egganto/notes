## Lesson 2: Series and Sigma Notation


### Summation Notation
A series can be represented in a compact form called **summation notation** or **sigma notation**.

$$\sum_{start}^{end} equation$$

Example:

$$\sum_{n=2}^5 3n+1$$
$$a_{2}=(3(2)+1)=7$$
$$...$$
$$a_{5}=(3(5)+1)=16$$
$$7+10+13+16=46$$

## Lesson 3: Arithmetic Sequences

### Formulas

$a_{1}                                  =$ first term<br>
$a_{n}                                  =$ the last term<br>
$n                                      =$ number of the term in the question<br>
$d                                      =$ the common difference<br>
Formula to find the $n$th term : $a_{n} = a_{1}+(n-1)d$<br>

## Lesson 4: Arithmetic Series

### Formulas

When $a_{n}$ is known:   $S_{n}=\frac{n}{2}(a_{1}+a_{n})$ <br>
When $a_{n}$ is unknown: $S_{n}=\frac{n}{2}(2a_{1}+(n-1)d)$<br>

## Lesson 5: Geometric Sequence

### Formulas
$r = \frac{a_{n}}{a_{n-1}}$<br> 
>the common ratio <br> 

$$
a_{n}=a_{1}(r^{n-1})
$$

| " | Geometric Series | " | " |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| finite | $\|r\|<1$<br> $\|r\|\geq1$ | $S_{n}=\frac{a_{1}(1-r^n)}{(1-r)}$ | Has a sum |
| infinite | $\|r\|<1$ | Converges<br> $S=\frac{a_{1}}{(1-r)}$ | Has a sum |
| infinite | $\|r\| \geq1$ | diverges | Has no sum<br> Or infinite $\infty$ sum |
