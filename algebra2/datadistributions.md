# data distributions

## measures of center and spread

### mean
- the **mean** of a data is its average
- is found by summing all values and then dividing by the total

### median
- the middle number, or the average of the middle two numbers in a data set
- if the data set has an even number of values, the median is the average of the mid two #s
- if the data set has an odd number of values, the median is the number in the middle of the set

### standard deviation

```math
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{k}\sum_{n=1}^k(n_n-x)^2}
```
