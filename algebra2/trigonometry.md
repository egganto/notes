# right triangle trigonometry
## triangle sides
| name | side |
| --- | --- |
| hypotenuse | the longest side of the triangle |
| side a | the side opposite to angle A (does not touch it) |
| side c | the side adjacent to side a (the leg that forms angle A with the hypotenuse) |

* sides are just examples, does not apply to all sides

## similar right triangles [souji]
+ two triangles with corresponding congruent angles and proportional corresponding sides

## trigonometric ratios
+ a ratio between two sides of a right triangle
+ three primary trigonometric ratios (trigonometric functions)
  - sine (sin)
  - cosine (cos)
  - tangent (tan)
  - a given angle in a right triangle is called theta

```math
sin(\Theta)=\frac{opposite}{adjacent}
```
```math
cos(\Theta)=\frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse}
```
```math
tan(\Theta)=\frac{opposite}{adjacent}
```
**SOH-CAH-TOA**

+ SOH: **s**ine equals **o**pposite over **h**ypotenuse
+ CAH: **c**osine equals **a**djacent over **h**ypotenuse
+ TOA: **t**angent equals **o**pposite over **a**djacent

1. triangle sum theorem
  - angle 1 + angle 2 + angle 3 = 180
2. trigonometric functions
  - SOH-CAH-TOA
3. pythagorean theorem
  - $ a^2+b^2=c^2 $

## reciprocal trigonometry functions

| trigonometry function | reciprocal function | definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sine (sin) | cosecant (csc) | $csc(\Theta)=\frac{1}{sin(\Theta)}=\frac{hypotenuse}{opposite}$ |
| cosine (cos) | secant (sec) | $sec(\Theta)=\frac{1}{cos(\Theta)}=\frac{hypotenuse}{adjacent}$ |
| tangent (tan) | cotangent (cot) | $cot(\Theta)=\frac{1}{tan(\Theta)=\frac{adjacent}{opposite}}$ |

# angles and their measures
## circumference
+ radius
  - the distance from the center of a circle to the edge
+ circumference
  - the distance around a circle
+ diameter
  - the width of a circle, from edge to edge through a circle/sphere

the ratio of the circumference of a circle is equal to $ \pi\,(3.14) $

```math
\pi=\frac{C}{d}
```
 solving of C in the equation above gives us:

 ```math
C=\pi d
 ```

 and since $ 2r=d $, you can also use $ C=2\pi r $

## the unit circle
+ has a radius of 1
+ has a circumference of $2\pi$
+ is drawn on the $xy$ plane
+ has its center at the origin of the plane (where the $x$ and $y$ axes meet)
+ is defined by the equation $x^2+y^2=1$

## arcs
arc length of a circle
```math
x=C\frac{n}{360}
```

approximate degree measure of an angle
```math
n=\frac{360x}{C}
```

## radians
+ another unit to measure angles (rad)
+ uses the size of the arc to measure the angle

```math
x\,rad=2\pi\frac{n\degree}{360\degree}
```

## common angles
![degree and radian measure](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.accelerate-ed.com/image/5dc7df75-9ef2-4c45-b8f8-eafa6a51eee7.jpg)

> a full circle ($360\degree$) is equal to $2\pi\,rad$
+ half a circle ($180\degree$) is rqual to $\pi\,rad$
+ a quarter circle ($90\degree$) is equal to $\frac{\pi}{2}\,rad$

> every $30\degree$ is equal to $\frac{\pi}{6}\,rad$
+ $30\degree$ is equal to $\frac{\pi}{6}rad$
+ $60\degree$ is equal to $\frac{2\pi}{6}$, or $\frac{\pi}{3}\,rad$
+ $90\degree$ is equal to $\frac{3\pi}{6}$, or $\frac{\pi}{2}\,rad$, and so on

# law of sines
+ is applicable to:
  - angle-angle-side (AAS)
  - angle-side-angle (ASA)
  - side-side-angle (SSA, ambiguous)

```math
\frac{a}{sin\,A}=\frac{b}{sin\,B}=\frac{c}{sin\,C\}
```

the numerator and denominator positions can be interchanged (flipped)

# law of cosines
+ is applicable to:
  - side-angle-side (SAS)
  - side-side-side (SSS)

```math
a^2=b^2+c^2-2bc\,cos\,A
```
```math
b^2=a^2+c^2-2ac\,cos\,B
```
```math
c^2=a^2+b^2-2ac\,cos\,C
```
