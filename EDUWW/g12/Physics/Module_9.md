## Heat, Work, and Thermodynamic Processes

Work Done by a Gas <br>
$W=\frac{F}{A}(Ad)$ <br>
$W=P(\Delta V)$ <br>

## First Law of Thermodynamics
Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed. <br>

$$
\Delta U=Q-W
$$

U = internal energy of the system <br>
Q = heat transferred to or from the system <br>
W = work done on or by the system <br>

### Ideal Processes
- Isothermal Process <br>
Work $\leftrightarrow$ Heat <br>
Temperature is constant, so U is constant too <br>
$\Delta U = 0$ <br>
$Q = W$ <br>

- Isovolumetric Process <br>
Heat $\leftrightarrow$ Internal Energy <br>
The volume doesn't change, so no work is done <br>
$W = 0$ <br>
$\Delta U = Q$ <br>

- Adiabatic Process <br>
Work $\leftrightarrow$ Internal Energy <br>
Work is done on/by the system, but no heat is transferred <br>
$Q = 0$ <br>
$\Delta U = -W$ <br>
<br>
If both Q and W are zero, then the equation would just become $U_i=U_f$

## Second Law of Thermodynamics
In the long run, entropy (disorder) always increases. <br>
More entropy = less energy available <br>
Entropy always increases unless energy is added. <br>

### Efficiency of Thermodynamic Processes
**Efficiency of an Engine** <br>

$$
eff=\frac{net\ work\ done\ by\ the\ engine}{heat\ added\ to\ the\ engine}=\frac{W_{net}}{Q_{h}}
$$

$$
eff=1-\frac{energy\ removed\ as\ heat}{energy\ added\ as\ heat}=1-\frac{Q_{c}}{Q_{h}}
$$

## Fluids

### Liquids and Gases
Both liquids and gases can flow and take shape of the container, so they are both called **fluids**. The only difference is that a liquid has a definite volume and a gas does not. <br>

### Fluid Pressure
Air and water obey the concept of fluid pressure. The amount of pressure exerted by a fluid is based on the density of the fluid, gravity, and the height or depth at which the point of observation is. <br>
(air pressure on the surface of the Earth, the depth would be equal to the depth of the atmosphere at that point). <br>

$$
P=\rho gh
$$

$P$ = pressure exerted by a stationary fluid <br>
$\rho$ = density of the fluid <br>
$g$ = acceleration of gravity <br>
$h$ = depth of the fluid <br>

| Substance | Density ($kg/m^3$) |
| ---       | ---                |
| water     | 997                |
| gasoline  | 737                |
| hydrogen  | 0.0899             |
| air       | 1.29               |
| iron      | 7.86 x $10^3$      |
| mercury   | 1.36 x $10^4$      |
| gold      | 1.93 x $10^4$      |

### Archimedes's Principle
The buoyant force of an object submerged is equal to the weight of the liquid it displaces. <br>

$$
F_{buoyant}=\rho V_{f}g
$$

$\rho$ = density of the fluid <br>
$V_{f}$ = volume of the displaced fluid <br>
$g$ = acceleteration of gravity <br>

$$
F_{buoyant}=m_{f}g=W_{f}
$$

$m_{g}$ = mass of the displacaed fluid <br>
g = acceleration of gravity <br>
$W_{f}$ = weight of the displaced fluid <br>

$$
F_{buoyant}=F_{g}-F_{aw}
$$

$F_{g}$ = weight of the object <br>
$F_{aw}$ = apparent weight of the object <br>

**Apparent Weight** <br>

$$
F_{net}=m\vec{a} =\vec{F}_{normal}+\vec{F}_{weight}
$$

### Sink or Float
Density ($\frac{mass}{volume}$) is key to floating or sinking!!1 <br>

<ins>3 simple rules:</ins>
1. Object is __more dense__ than liquid = __sink__ <br>
2. Object is __less dense__ than liquid = __floats__ <br>
3. Object with __equal density__ to liquid = __no sink/float__ <br>

| Object            | Density ($kg/m^3$) |
| ---               | ---                |
| cement            | 1201               |
| coconut oil       | 924                |
| maple syrup       | 1362               |
| iron chips        | 2643               |
| lima beans        | 721                |
| ice               | 881                |
| unshelled peanuts | 240                |
| sandstone         | 1281               |

### Pascal's Principle
A change in pressure at any point in an enclosed fluid at rest is transmitted to all other points of the fluid, including the walls of the container.
